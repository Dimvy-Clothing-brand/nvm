          ## Security Assessment

          ### ✅ Passed Checks
          - Script syntax validation
          - Basic security pattern analysis
          - Network operation review

          ### ⚠️ Warnings
          - Manual review recommended for PATH manipulations
          - Network operations detected (expected for nvm functionality)

          ### 📋 Recommendations
          - Continue regular security audits
          - Monitor dependency vulnerabilities
          - Keep installation scripts updated
